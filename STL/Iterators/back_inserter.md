`std::back_inserter` is a C++ function template that creates a special type of iterator, called a "back-insert iterator." This iterator is designed to add elements to the end of a container by using its `push_back` function. It’s especially useful with algorithms that write to an output iterator.

### How `std::back_inserter` Works

1. **Wrapper for `push_back`**: When you pass a container (like `std::vector`, `std::deque`, or `std::list`) to `std::back_inserter`, it creates an iterator that, when dereferenced or incremented, calls `push_back` on the container. This means each time a value is "assigned" to this iterator, it actually adds an element to the container.

2. **Usage with Output Iterators**: Many STL algorithms (e.g., `std::copy`, `std::set_union`, `std::set_difference`) require an output iterator to store the result. `std::back_inserter` is ideal here, as it automatically resizes the container by appending elements, allowing you to avoid needing to pre-size the container for the output.

3. **Dynamic Resizing**: Using `std::back_inserter` means you don’t need to manually manage the size of the container; it expands as needed when new elements are added.

### Example Code with `std::back_inserter`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> original = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> result;

    // Copy elements from 'original' to 'result' using std::back_inserter
    std::copy(original.begin(), original.end(), std::back_inserter(result));

    // Display contents of result
    std::cout << "Result after copying: ";
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation
- `std::back_inserter(result)` creates a back-insert iterator for the `result` vector.
- `std::copy(original.begin(), original.end(), std::back_inserter(result));` uses this back-insert iterator to copy each element from `original` to `result`.
- The `result` vector resizes dynamically as elements are added to its end.

### When to Use `std::back_inserter`
- **With Resizable Containers**: It's typically used with containers that support `push_back`, like `std::vector`, `std::deque`, and `std::list`.
- **For Convenience**: It eliminates the need to manually set the container size beforehand.
- **With STL Algorithms**: It’s perfect when using algorithms that require an output iterator, as it handles dynamic resizing automatically.

### Important Points
- `std::back_inserter` only works with containers that support the `push_back` operation. Containers like `std::set` or `std::map` do not support `push_back` and thus cannot be used with `std::back_inserter`.
- It’s a convenient and efficient way to append data, particularly in cases where the final size of the container is not known in advance.

### How `std::back_inserter` Operates Internally

Under the hood, `std::back_inserter` wraps the container’s `push_back` operation. When used in an algorithm, it behaves like this:

1. **Dereference**: When the iterator is dereferenced (e.g., `*it = value`), the iterator doesn’t simply assign a value—it calls `push_back(value)` on the underlying container.
2. **Increment/Decrement**: The increment operation `++it` is a no-op, meaning it doesn’t actually move the iterator. This makes sense because `std::back_inserter` only ever inserts at the end of the container, so there's no need to change positions.
